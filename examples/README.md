# Example deployment / Local development setup

This provides an example of how NAuth can be configured together with NATS.
They are designed to work together with the `mise` installation tasks (but can be found as scripts under `.mise-tasks`).

The secrets provided as manifests in NAuth are only available to quickly be able to setup a local environment. Do not
use these in you production environment. Instead, follow the [operator-bootstrap](../operator-bootstrap/README.md)
instructions to get an example of how to generate your own.
