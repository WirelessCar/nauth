# Getting Started with nauth

This guide will help you get started with nauth, a Kubernetes operator for managing decentralized authentication & authorization for NATS.

## What is nauth?

NAuth allows platform teams to provide easy multi-tenancy support for development teams by providing `Account` & `User` CRDs that conveniently package:

- Account creation & updates  
- Account exports & imports
- User creation & credentials delivery

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A running Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` configured to access your cluster  
- Helm 3.x installed
- A NATS operator and system account (see [operator-bootstrap](https://github.com/wirelesscar/nauth/tree/main/operator-bootstrap))

:::caution[Early Development]
This project is in early development. There will likely be breaking changes before getting to a stable release.

## Quick Start

1. **Install nauth using Helm:**

   ```bash
   # Add the nauth Helm repository
   helm repo add nauth https://wirelesscar.github.io/nauth
   
   # Install nauth
   helm install nauth nauth/nauth
   ```

2. **Verify the installation:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n nauth-system
   ```

3. **Create your first Account:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: nauth.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Account
   metadata:
     name: my-account
     namespace: default
   spec:
     accountLimits:
       conn: 100
       exports: 10
       imports: 10
   ```

4. **Create a User for the Account:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: nauth.io/v1alpha1
   kind: User
   metadata:
     name: my-user
     namespace: default
   spec:
     accountName: my-account
     permissions:
       pub:
         allow: ["my.>"]
       sub:
         allow: ["my.>"]
   ```
